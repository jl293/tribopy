The roughness is represented by spherical asperities whose heights follow some statistical distribution. If it is assumed that the asperities deform independently of each other in response to load, the Hertz contact model can be applied to each asperity to calculate local deformation of the areas for individual asperities.

        The Vogel equation is a purely empirical model that is highly accurate because it has three independent constants. Note that the temperature units must be consistent.

        Since there are three constants in this equation, it should be fit using more temperature-viscosity data points than the two-parameter models in this class. Due to the accuracy and closed form of this equation, it is commonly used in numerical solutions for lubrication of non-conformal contacts.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        At lower pressures, viscosity can be assumed to be constant. However, as pressure increases to the order of tens of MPa and above, viscosity can increase with increasing pressure. This increase is quantified by the pressure-viscosity coefficient a (alpha). There are various definitions of a, but the simplest is based on the Barus equation.

        Absolute or kinematic viscosity can be used in this formulation as long as the viscosity at p and ambient viscosity have the same units. The pressure-viscosity coefficeint a has units of [1/presure] and is typically on the order of 10 [1/GPa] for lubricating oils.

        The Barus equation is known to be inaccurate for many lubricants and conditions. However, its simple functional form conveys the exponential nature of the pressure-viscosity relationship. Also, the large magnitude of a (alpha) correctly indicates that the exponential term will only become significant at high pressures, consistent with physical observations.
